## Welcome üëã

Thank you for choosing to contribute to the community. We do all the development of our templates on GitHub. If you are not familiar with GitHub or pull requests, here is an [excellent guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to get started.

## What do I need to know? ü§î

If you're looking to help with contributions to any of the templates, our templates use the technology mentioned in the repository name, so you have to know a bit of the language to make code contributions.

If you don't feel like making code contributions, that is fine, you can read through the [issues list ](#) to see if there's any documentation related issue you can fix üòâ

### Code of Conduct

It is of utmost importance that every memeber of the community is treated rightly and we are very respectful to one another. Our code of conduct exists so that we all know how to treat each other in the community with kindness. Please see our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

We make use of issue labels to mark issues based on their type or severity, here are the available labels:

- `Bug` : Mark your issue or PR with this label if you're tying to fix a bug or report a bug

- `feature request` : Mark your issue with this label if you're submitting a feature request

- `first contribution` : Your first pull request is marked with this label when it is merged or apporved.

- `cla-signed`: To you submit a pull request, you'll be required to sign our contributor license agreement (CLA). When you've signed it, your pull request will be marked with this label.

## How do I Contribute? üìù

#### Contributing to a Template

Here's a quick rundown of how to contribute to any of our templates

- If you have a feature idea you'd like to see in the template, create a [feature request](https://github.com/chadwcarlson/metabase/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request&template=feature_request.md&title=)

- Find an issue that you are interested in addressing from the [issues list](/issues) or a change that you would like to add.

- Fork the repository you'd like to contribute to.

- Clone the repository you forked to your local machine using `git clone`

- Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b <branch name>.`

- Make the changes you need to make based on the issue you've selected to fix or the change you want to make.

- Add and commit the changes you've made using `git add` and `git commit` respectively

- During commit, use a very clear and descriptive commit message of your changes

- Push the changes you've made to the repository you forked using `git push origin your-branch-name`

- Go to your repo and create a Pull Request

- While creating a pull request, please follow the pull request template provided and fill in information about your pull request where necessary.

- Submit the pull request and wait for a member of the team to review

- If the pull request reviewer requests for changes of any kind, go ahead and make those changes and push to the repo again.

#### Contributing Content

We are very passionate about our community and we are actively seeking for more ways we can amplify the voices of every member of our community. We welcome all contributions from the community and we are really excited about it. Contributions are not just code related, we encourage you to submit any form of content to the community. Here is a list of what content contribution can look like:

- Platform.sh Templates for various language/frameworks

- Your story on how PSH is impacting your project/company

- Blog Posts and Case Studies

- Talks and Tutorial videos

- Workshop materials

To submit any type of content, you can reach out to the DevRel team via any of the channels in the [help](#where-can-i-go-for-help) section
